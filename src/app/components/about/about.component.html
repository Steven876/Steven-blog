          Hi there! I hope you're doing well. I'm Steven Armstrong, a passionate 
          Computer Science student currently pursuing my degree at the University of 
          Technology, Jamaica.

          My journey into the world of software development began when I was a child. I used to 
          spend hours playing video games with friends and family until one day, I found myself 
          wondering, how are games even made? That single question sparked my curiosity and set 
          me on the path I'm on today. Since then, I've been fascinated by how technology can solve real world 
          problems and even more excited by the idea that I could be the one building those solutions.


        </p>
        
        <p>
        
          Throughout my academic career, I've explored various pathways in computer science, 
          from data structures and algorithms to software design methodologies. This blog is 
          my space to document what I'm learning, showcase my projects, and connect with fellow 
          tech enthusiasts along the way.
